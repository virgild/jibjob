JibJob

by Virgil Dimaguila <virgild>


JibJob is a Sinatra web app for distributing your online resume and exporting them in various formats.

The code is still in cleanup stage and has the following limitations:
  * The data migration code is for MySQL only. Although there is no MySQL specific SQL in the DataMapper models.
    Still waiting for dm-migrations to stabilize a bit.
  * Lots of untested/uncovered code--mostly in the controllers. Too lazy to mock (yet).


Please send feedback.
