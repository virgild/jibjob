JibJob is an online resume document generator . It is a simple service that 
lets you compose your resumes using plain text and generate a PDF file or 
a formatted text version. It uses the Sinatra micro web framework and written
in Ruby. 


Developer Notes

The code is still in cleanup stage and has the following limitations:
  * The data migration code is for MySQL only, although there is no MySQL specific SQL in the DataMapper models.
    Still waiting for dm-migrations to stabilize a bit.
  * Lots of untested/uncovered code--mostly in the controllers methods
