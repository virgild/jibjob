      # 2.2.3. Long Header Fields
      # 
      #  Each header field is logically a single line of characters comprising
      #  the field name, the colon, and the field body.  For convenience
      #  however, and to deal with the 998/78 character limitations per line,
      #  the field body portion of a header field can be split into a multiple
      #  line representation; this is called "folding".  The general rule is
      #  that wherever this standard allows for folding white space (not
      #  simply WSP characters), a CRLF may be inserted before any WSP.  For
      #  example, the header field:
      #  
      #          Subject: This is a test
      #  
      #  can be represented as:
      #  
      #          Subject: This
      #           is a test
      #  
      #  Note: Though structured field bodies are defined in such a way that
      #  folding can take place between many of the lexical tokens (and even
      #  within some of the lexical tokens), folding SHOULD be limited to
      #  placing the CRLF at higher-level syntactic breaks.  For instance, if
      #  a field body is defined as comma-separated values, it is recommended
      #  that folding occur after the comma separating the structured items in
      #  preference to other places where the field could be folded, even if
      #  it is allowed elsewhere.
